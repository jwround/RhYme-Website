*<b>Actinowax™ is a luxurious emollient with a skin-temperature melting point and a unique composition of wax esters comparable to those found on youthful skin and hair.</b>*

In the cosmetic industry, wax ester-based emollients are highly sought for their excellent absorptive and sensory properties, as well as their formulative stability. Actinowax™, a complex wax ester-rich material, is well positioned as a high-performance emollient for premium cosmetic and personal care products. A “dry” emollient with a melting point just below skin temperature, Actinowax™ imparts luxurious, light, and non-greasy sensory properties that can be formulated over a wide range of applications. Specific applications include use as a stabilizer and co-emulsifier in skin creams and hair conditioners, and as a wetting agent in sunscreens and colour cosmetics.
