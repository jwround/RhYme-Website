Microbial catabolic activities underpin life on our planet. On the global scale, these enzymes and pathways are essential to the carbon cycle of the biosphere. They also maintain the health of all ecosystems ranging from ocean and forest environments to the different parts of the human body.

*<b>Actinowax™ is a luxurious emollient with a skin-temperature melting point and a unique composition of wax esters comparable to those found on youthful skin and hair.</b>*

In the cosmetic industry, wax ester-based emollients are highly sought for their excellent absorptive and sensory properties, as well as their formulative stability. Actinowax™, a complex wax ester-rich material, is well positioned as a high-performance emollient for premium cosmetic and personal care products. A “dry” emollient with a melting point just below skin temperature, Actinowax™ imparts luxurious, light, and non-greasy sensory properties that can be formulated over a wide range of applications. Specific applications include use as a stabilizer and co-emulsifier in skin creams and hair conditioners, and as a wetting agent in sunscreens and colour cosmetics. The physicochemical characteristics of Actinowax™ will allow it to address a gap in organic or natural product formulation, currently lacking in certified “dry” emollients with skin-temperature melting points. 

Actinowax™ is a unique source of both branched- and odd-chain wax esters, which have been shown to improve and strengthen the cutaneous barrier, smoothing skin and preventing transepidermal water loss (1, 2). Indeed, the wax esters of Actinowax™ are highly similar to those found on human skin and hair (3, 4). As we age, our body produces reduced amounts of wax esters (5), by replacing them, products that incorporate Actinowax™ may prevent and reverse signs of ageing.

*<b>A prebiotic for healthy skin</b>*

The branched- and odd-chain wax esters found in Actinowax™ may promote a balanced microbiome and healthy skin. The metabolism of these unique lipids by the skin microbiome results in the production of short-chain fatty acids that are known to modulate human and microbiome health (6). Furthermore, these lipids can be incorporated into lipid membranes of the microbiome, helping them to interact with human skin (7).
