Microbial catabolic activities underpin life on our planet. On the global scale, these enzymes and pathways are essential to the carbon cycle of the biosphere. They also maintain the health of all ecosystems ranging from ocean and forest environments to the different parts of the human body. Microorganisms have evolved an astoundingly versatile armamentarium of enzymes to degrade the vast array of compounds that occur in the biosphere. As a rich source of biocatalysts, microbial catabolic activities are of burgeoning importance for the sustainability of the agricultural, food, textile, pharmaceutical and chemical industries. In pathogens, catabolic activities that play essential roles in the infection process provide potential targets for novel therapeutics, which are urgently needed in this era of increasing antibiotic resistance. The enormous diversity and importance of microbial catabolic activities are being revealed through high-throughput sequencing and related projects. However, our understanding of the molecular basis of these activities lags far behind as reflected by the huge number of poorly-annotated genes in microbial databases. Linking sequence to function is essential for understanding and exploiting microbial catabolic activities.
