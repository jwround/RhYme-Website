***New technologies are helping to solve global problems***

Our world relies on lipid-based chemicals, we use them in our cosmetics, lubricants, foods, and fuels. But as demands for these products grow, so does the environmental and societal burden associated with palm oil from which most are derived. Rising consumer awareness is challenging industries to reduce their dependence on palm oil, but current technologies are struggling to provide alternatives.

RhYme is harnessing the power of *Rhodococcus*, a naturally occurring soil bacterium, to create high-value lipid-based molecules. By applying advances in DNA technology and biological engineering, we are developing a technology that converts sustainable sugars into products that not only reduce our dependence on palm oil, but also bring preformance benefits.
