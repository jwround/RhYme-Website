***Uncompromising performance***

Actinowax™ is a wax ester-based emollient for premium cosmetic and personal care products. With a melting point just below skin temperature, Actinowax™ imparts luxurious, light, and non-greasy sensory properties that can be formulated over a wide range of applications. 

Actinowax™ is a unique source of branched- and odd-chain wax esters that are naturally found on human skin. Aging skin produces less of these molecules, by replacing them, Actinowax™ helps to improve and strengthen the cutaneous barrier, smoothing skin and preventing transepidermal water loss.

***Uncompromising responsibility***

Actinowax™ is produced by the industrial fermentation of sustainable sugars. By replacing ingredients derived from palm oil with sustainable and ethical alternatives, we can reduce the environmental impact of cosmetic products.
