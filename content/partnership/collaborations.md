RhYme is developing technologies to bring uncompromising high-performance emollients to cosmetics. We would love your help. 

We aim to develop partnerships to scale-up and manufacture cosmetic products, encompassing expertise in the development and deployment of cosmetic products and ingredients. As an interim step, we are also interested in speaking to potential co-development partners with medium- to high-throughput strain engineering and fermentation infrastructure.
