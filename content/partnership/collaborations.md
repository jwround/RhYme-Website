RhYme Biotechnology is building a team with deep expertise in the use and engineering of *Rhodococcus* and product development through strategic out-sourcing and partnerships. We seek to find strategic partners in the following areas to co-develop and distribute our technology. 



We aim to develop partnerships to scale-up and manufacture cosmetic products, encompassing expertise in the development and deployment of cosmetic products and ingredients. As an interim step, we are also interested in speaking to potential co-development partners with medium- to high-throughput strain engineering and fermentation infrastructure.
