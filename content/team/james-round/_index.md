Oleaginous bacteria have considerable potential for the sustainable production of lipid-based chemicals. James' research characterized and exploited lipid biosynthesis enzymes to create a biocatalyst. The work provides insight into bacterial lipid biosynthesis and facilitates the development of processes to sustainably produce oleochemicals.
