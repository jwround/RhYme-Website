abstract: "Oleaginous microorganisms, such as those found in the Rhodococcus genus, have considerable potential for the sustainable prodn. of lipid-based chems. Herein, we rewired lipid accumulation in Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 to create an industrially viable biocatalyst for the prodn. of high-value wax esters (WEs). To efficiently manipulate these non-model bacteria, we first expanded the genetic tools available in rhodococci, creating pSYN, an integrative, modular expression vector. We employed this vector to screen predicted promoters, creating a library of strong constitutive promoters. RHA1 strains with a chromosomal insertion of fcrA, encoding a fatty acyl-CoA reductase, under the control of constitutive promoters accumulated WEs. We next screened wax synthases, identifying WS2 of Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus DSM 8798 as the most effective at increasing WE levels in RHA1. Cassettes for the coexpression of chromosomally integrated fcrA and ws2 were created and transformed into RHA1, yielding a biocatalyst that, when grown in flasks, accumulated WEs to greater than 15% CDW, at yields of 0.05 g per g glucose, while maintaining 80% of the specific growth rate of WT. The accumulated WEs were 29 to 38 carbon atoms in length, of which 75% were unsatd., with a âˆ¼2 : 1 mix of mono- and diunsatd. species. In fed-batch fermns., the biocatalyst produced WEs with a titer, rate, and yield of approx. 5 g L-1, 1 g L-1 day-1, and 0.025 g per g glucose, resp. Overall, these results highlight the potential of Rhodococcus for the sustainable prodn. of high-value unsatd. WEs, and facilitate the development of this genus for biocatalytic applications.
