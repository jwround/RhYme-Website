abstract: "Hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) is a widely used explosive and a major soil and groundwater contaminant. Organisms such as Gordonia sp. KTR9, capable of degrading RDX and using it as an N source, may prove useful for bioremediation of contaminated sites. XplA is a cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase responsible for RDX degrdn. Expression of xplA in KTR9 was not induced by RDX but was strongly induced (50-fold) during N-limited growth. When glnR, encoding a regulatory protein affecting N assimilation in diverse Actinobacteria, was deleted from KTR9, the bacterium lost the ability to use nitrate, nitrite, and RDX as N sources. Deletion of glnR also abolished the inhibition of xplA expression by nitrite. Our results confirm the essential role of GlnR in regulating assimilation of nitrite, but there was no evidence for a direct role of GlnR in regulating XplA expression. Rather, the general availability of nitrogen repressed XplA expression. We conclude that the inability of the glnR mutant to use RDX as an N source was due to its inability to assimilate nitrite, an intermediate in the assimilation of nitrogen from RDX. Regulation of XplA does not seem adaptive for KTR9, but it is important for RDX bioremediation with KTR9 or similar bacteria. [on SciFinder(R)]"
