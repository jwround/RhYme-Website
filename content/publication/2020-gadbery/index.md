abstract: "Steroid-degrading bacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), utilize an architecturally distinct subfamily of acyl CoA dehydrogenases (ACADs) for steroid catabolism. These ACADs are α2β2 heterotetramers that are usually encoded by adjacent fadE-like genes. In mycobacteria, ipdE1 and ipdE2 (formerly fadE30 and fadE33) occur in divergently transcribed operons assocd. with the catabolism of 3aα-H-4α(3'-propanoate)-7aβ-methylhexahydro-1,5-indanedione (HIP), a steroid metabolite. In Mycobacterium smegmatis, ΔipdE1 and ΔipdE2 mutants had similar phenotypes, showing impaired growth on cholesterol and accumulating 5-OH HIP in the culture supernatant. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that IpdE1 and IpdE2 share many of the features of the α- and β-subunits, resp., of heterotetrameric ACADs that are encoded by adjacent genes in many steroid-degrading proteobacteria. When coproduced in a rhodococcal strain, IpdE1 and IpdE2 of Mtb formed a complex that catalyzed the dehydrogenation of 5OH-HIP CoA (5OH-HIP-CoA) to 5OH-3aα-H-4α(3'-prop-1-enoate)-7aβ-methylhexa-hydro-1,5-indanedione CoA ((E)-5OH-HIPE-CoA). This corresponds to the initial step in the pathway that leads to degrdn. of steroid C and D rings via β-oxidn. Small-angle X-ray scattering revealed that the IpdE1-IpdE2 complex was an α2β2 heterotetramer typical of other ACADs involved in steroid catabolism. These results provide insight into an important class of steroid catabolic enzymes and a potential virulence determinant in Mtb. [on SciFinder(R)]"
